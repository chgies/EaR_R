This Repository is used for my BA Thesis, which is about Emotion and Rapport recognition in remote therapy situations.

Start pose extraction by downloading the CANDOR and CAER datasets, adding them to your PATH and execute pose_processing.py

Currently implemented:
    - pose extraction from CANDOR into csv files
    - pose extraction of CAER into csv files
    - skeleton functions for doing extractions in a cloud environment

Started:
    - feature extraction of CAER csv files

You can find information for feature extraction and further use in the 'references' folder

This code is work in progress.
